# This function compute the exact Wasserstein distance between two probability distributions

def Wasserstein_distance_LP(p, q, M_dist):
    """
    Inputs:
    *p: (n x 1) probability measure
    *q: (m x 1) probability measure
    *M_dist: (n x m) matrix giving distances between the locations of supports p and q
    
    Outputs:
    *Distance_exact: (float) Wasserstein distance between p and q
    *Pi_exact: (n x m) Transport matrix between p and q
    *Time: (float) time spent to compute the result
    
    Infos:
    LP resolution solving: Wasserstein_distance(p,q) (p and q have the same support)
    *function to minimize: c @ x
    *constraints: A @ x = p and B @ x = q
    The massive linear program is run with the HiGHS method (see more on HiGHS.dev)
